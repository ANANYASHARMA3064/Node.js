//trying not to be stuck in a tutoriall hell I am trying to revise 
// const http =require(http)
// const server = http.createServer((req,res)=>{

// })
// server.listen(5000)
//  req (request) and res (response) is key to working with servers in Node.js. Here's a breakdown of what each one is and how they work:
// The req object represents the incoming request from the client (usually a browser, app, or API client like Postman).

// It contains details about what the client is asking for.
// the res object is what you send back to the client. You use it to build the response.
// server.listen(5000);This tells the server to start listening for incoming requests on port 5000.
// A method is a function inside an object:
// In res.write .write is a method 
res	The response you (the server) send to the client
res.writeHead()	Set status code & headers
res.end(data)	Send back the body and close the connection
packages, modules and dependencies are used interchangebly
