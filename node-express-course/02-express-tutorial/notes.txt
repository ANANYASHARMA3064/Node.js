---------------Middleware--------------------------
💡 Middleware in Express is basically:
“A function that runs between the request coming in and the response going out.”
Think of your Express app like an airport security line:

You (the request) arrive at the airport (server).
Before you can board (get a response), you pass through checkpoints (middleware).
Each checkpoint can:
Look at you (req)
Change something about you
Decide to stop you entirely
Or let you pass to the next checkpoint
----------------------------------------------------
--------------------POST----------------------------
That app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false })) is the thing that takes your form’s name + age when you hit "submit" and makes it readable for your server code.

Without it:

Browser sends the data to your server, but Express just shrugs and says,
“Uh, I see a body here… but I have no idea what’s inside.”
req.body would be undefined.
With it:
Express opens the body, parses the name=Ananya&age=18 string,
Turns it into { name: "Ananya", age: "18" },
And now your route handler can do stuff with it (store in DB, show on admin page, etc.).
So yeah — your form is just a messenger 📨, but this middleware is the translator that makes the server understand what the form was saying.
If you want, I can write you a minimal working example where the webpage posts your name+age, and the server just logs it and sends a cheeky response back.

You said:
what does the extended: false do here 
ChatGPT said:
Alright, here’s the tea on extended: false in express.urlencoded({ extended: false }):
When the browser sends form data, it’s in URL-encoded format — basically a long string like:
name=Ananya&age=18
That { extended: false } part tells Express how to turn that string into a JS object:
extended: false → Use the old, built-in querystring parser.
Only handles simple data like { name: "Ananya", age: "18" }.
If your form sends arrays, nested objects, or fancy data, this parser won’t handle them.
extended: true → Use the qs library (richer parser).
Handles more complex stuff, e.g.
?user[name]=Ananya&user[age]=18
becomes:
{ user: { name: "Ananya", age: "18" } }
So in your case,
extended: false is fine if your form is just “name” and “age” or other flat fields.
If you wanted nested objects or arrays from your form, you’d go extended: true.
If you want, I can show you side-by-side examples of what extended: false vs extended: true gives you for the same form data — it’s kinda fun to see.
